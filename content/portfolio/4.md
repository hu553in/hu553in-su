## üß© Project Overview

A cloud-based service for organizations that provides the following contact center features:

- voice calls
- messaging
- video conferences

Also, this service provides possibilities such as:

- different types of statistics and reports for features described above
- call recordings
- configurable routing of communication requests between different contact center agents
- delegated routing -- re-use our routing engine to route requests from external CRM systems
- tools to supervise agent work
- flexible group-based isolation of data accessible by different users (in terms of single customer)

I am working here as a backend developer / acting tech lead.

## üõ†Ô∏è My Responsibilities

- Backend development of core services and APIs using Java, Kotlin and Go.
- Acting as tech lead: code reviews, architecture discussions, participation
  and execution of activities such as planning and PBR.
- Designing and implementing highly reusable, fault-tolerant and extendable solutions
  for various platform components.
- Driving integration with 3rd-party systems ‚Äî even when the documentation was outdated or missing.
- Actively collaborating with other devs as well as QA and PO teams to clarify and properly
  implement complex and ambiguous features.
- Investigating and fixing deeply rooted bugs, including legacy or cross-project issues.
- Running SQL/JVM profiling and performance optimizations in collaboration with the performance squad.
- Regularly refactoring legacy code and improving the test infrastructure across services.
- Actively participating in the development of the team culture.

## üéØ Key Achievements

- Completely redesigned the delegated auth flow with Salesforce, despite lack of official docs ‚Äî
  making it consistent and fault-tolerant.
- Removed outdated QueryDSL from a giant legacy service, replacing it with native Criteria API ‚Äî
  a massive refactoring effort.
- Built a custom event queue for Salesforce integration to handle parallel and sequential load
  using key-based separation.
- Introduced generic and scalable solutions:
  - Sync of account settings and legacy integrations.
  - Extendable logic for entity mapping APIs.
  - Clean structure for complex isolation logic using various design patterns.
- Fixed numerous critical bugs, including tricky edge cases like isolation misbehaviors or stale resources.
- Accelerated CI pipelines, added missing test coverage tools, and finalized long-standing frozen tasks.
- Launched the initial version of API client code generation together with another teammate.
- Actively contributed to architecture discussions and continuous improvement of squad processes.

## ü§ù Impact & Communication

- Delivered multiple cross-team business features that directly contributed to acquiring new enterprise clients.
- Served as a connector between squads, helping others with technical investigations and feature clarifications.
- Onboarded a new teammate and guided their growth.
- Maintained proactive and transparent communication, driving discussions around priorities, design, and improvements.
