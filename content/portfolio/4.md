## Description

A cloud-based service for organizations that provides the following contact center features:

- voice calls
- messaging
- video conferences

Also, this service provides possibilities such as:

- different types of statistics and reports for features described above
- call recordings
- configurable routing of communication requests between different contact center agents
- delegated routing -- re-use our routing engine to route requests from external CRM systems
- tools to supervise agent work
- flexible group-based isolation of data accessible by different users (in terms of single customer)

I am working here as a backend developer.

## My tasks

- implement new features and fix bugs in the system core and user management microservice
- design and implement from scratch:
  - delegated routing feature on top of existing internal routing engine
  - group-based isolation feature on top of all existing non-isolated entities
