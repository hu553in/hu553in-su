## üß© Project Overview

A cloud-based service for organizations which filters requests
by specified policies and blocks an access to the undesirable content on the Internet.

The filtering policies are based on domain names and wildcards, content categories, etc.

Also, the service can force safe search mode on Google, YouTube, Bing, etc.

Full trace of all passed traffic is present on service.

I have worked here as a full-stack developer.
