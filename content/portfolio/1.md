# Description

A cloud-based service for organizations which filters requests
by specified policies and blocks an access to the undesirable content on the Internet.

The filtering policies are based on domain names and wildcards, content categories, etc.

Also, the service can force safe search mode on Google, YouTube, Bing, etc.

Full trace of all passed traffic is present on service.

I have worked here as a full-stack developer.

# Characteristics

- highload -- the system scales to support any amount of requests per second
- microservice architecture -- many modules which interact with each other
- distribution -- servers are located nearby to users all over the world
- caching -- requests are cached in order to prevent frequent processing of repeating requests
- logging -- the data about each request is stored in database
